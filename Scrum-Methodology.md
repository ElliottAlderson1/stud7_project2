## Sprints
An iteration in Scrum using a timebox of one month or less. JCU uses two week sprints.

### Sprint Backlog
Includes the Sprint Goal, select items from the product backlog, and the plan for delivering the increment.

Should be adapted throughout the sprint as more is learned.

Detailed enough to allow for inspection of progress throughout the sprint.

### Sprint Planning
Why is this Sprint valuable? What can be Done this Sprint? How will the chosen work get done? 

### Daily Scrum
15-minute daily meetings for developers to inspect progress and adapt planned work as new lessons are learned

### Sprint Review
Used to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. Periodic demonstrations to allow the product owner to accept or decline stories.

### Sprint Retrospective
The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done, to increase quality and effectiveness
