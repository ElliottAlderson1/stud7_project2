#### Definable Work
Majority of steps defined beforehand, clear procedures, uncertainty and risk are low. **RDIVM**

#### High-Uncertainty Work
Unpredictable, require collaboration, high rate of change.

## The Four Values
### 1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
### 2. Working Software over comprehension documentation
### 3. Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
### 4. Responding to Change over following a Plan

## The Twelve Principles
1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
4. Close, daily cooperation between business, people and developers.
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

## Project Management Characteristics
### Servant Leadership
- **Purpose** Work with the team to define the “why” or purpose so they can engage and coalesce around the goal for the project. The entire team optimizes at the project level, not the person level.
- **People** Once the purpose is established, encourage the team to create an environment where everyone can succeed. Ask each team member to contribute across the project work.
- **Process** Do not plan on following the “perfect” agile process, but instead look for the results. When a crossfunctional team delivers finished value often and reflects on the product and process, the teams are agile. It does not matter what the team calls its process.

### Team Structure
- **Dedicated People**
- **Cross-functional team members**
- **Mixed Team of generalists and specialists**

### Team Roles
- **Cross-functional team members**
- **Product Owner**
- **Team facilitator**

# Agile Lifecycle
## Four Categories

#### Predictive Lifecycle
Things are known and proven.

#### Iterative Lifecycle
Feedback on partially completed work or unfinished to improve it.

#### Incremental Life Cycle
Finish deliverables that customer may be able to use. Deliver successive subsets to improve it.

#### Agile Life Cycle
Iterative and Incremental. Provides early feedback or solutions, planning throughout, can include iterative and flow based.

#### Iterative Based Agile
Time allotted for each iteration is the same.

#### Flow Based Agile
Takes time for each feature, not the same for each feature.

# Agile Work Structure
### User Stories
A statement that describes the functionality needed in a solution
### Epics
When the user story is too large to be completed in a single iteration, it is considered to be an epic.
Epics are decomposed/broken down into stories (decomposed, as it is on Agile cert exam) 
### Features
A set of related requirements typically described as a short phrase. Usually related to story.
### Tasks
Created to deliver user stories. In some projects, stories and tasks can be used interchangeably. 
### Time boxing
A fixed period of time. A common Agile timebox example is daily Scrum meetings, called stand-up meetings.
### Iterations
Agile term for a fixed amount of time in which development efforts take place
## Backlog
A backlog is an ordered list of all work
### Daily Stand-up
Allow teams to micro commit to each other, uncover problems, and ensure the work flows smoothly through the team
### Reviews
Periodic demonstrations that allow the product owner to accepts or decline stories
### Retrospectives
A regularly occurring workshop in which participants explore their work and results in order to improve both process and product

# Agile Practices

### Scrum
- Single-team process framework
- Iterative approach with timeboxes between 1 and 4 weeks
- Team consists of a product owner, development team, and scrum master
### Kanban
Kanban emphasizes continuous flow, visualizing work stages, and setting work-in-progress limits

### Scrumban
Scrumban combines Scrum's structured sprints with Kanban's flow approach

### Scaled Agile Framework
Developed for large scale enterprises with larger teams than traditional agile

## Agile Metrics 
Metrics are established using story points which are relative measures of complexity for a story. Velocity is the amount of story points that can be completed in an iteration

**Burndown chart** shows how much work is yet to be completed while the **Burnup chart** shows how much work has been completed

**Task Boards** shows workflow from left to right. Used in kanban

# Planning an Agile Project

## Needs Assessment
Identify the problem or opportunity that requires action. 
Problem (or opportunity) of “a” Has the effect of “b” With the impact of “c”

## Elicitation
Drawing information from stakeholders. An Elicitation plan helps formulate ideas about how to structure the elicitation activities
### Develop the elicitation plan
Determine the information needed to define the problem, Identify who has the information, Determine the method that will be used, Sequence the elicitation activities.
### Prepare for elicitation
- Determining the objectives
- Determining the participants
- Determining the questions for each session
  - Open-ended question. A question that allows the respondents to answer in any way they desire
  - Closed-ended question. A question that calls for a response from a limited list of answer choices. Types of closed-ended questions are forced choice, limited choice, and confirmation
  - Contextual question. A question that requires an answer regarding the subject at hand; namely, the problem domain or the proposed solutions
  - Context-free question. A question that may be asked in any situation. Context-free questions are also used as lead-ins to obtain information to define the solution.

### Conduct Elicitation Activities
1. Introduction: sets the stage, sets the pace, and establishes the overall purpose for the elicitation session
2. Body: Questions are asked, and the answers are given
3. Close: Provides a graceful termination to the session
4. Follow-Up: Information is consolidated and confirmed with the participants.

### Document outputs from activities
Results of elicitation activities should be analyzed and documented

### Complete Elicitation
The elicitation process may require multiple iterations of collection and analysis to complete

### Defining the Product Goal
The product owner defines the goal, and the development team delivers the goal 


## Agile Project
### Minimum Viable Product
A version of a product with just enough features so that end-users can begin immediately using it and provide feedback for future product development

### Story Points
A unit of measure agreed upon by a team to measure the effort 
### Sprint Goal
The  single objective for the Sprint
The product owner is responsible for describing the goal and identifying the backlog items that contribute to it

### Sprint Backlog
Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal.
