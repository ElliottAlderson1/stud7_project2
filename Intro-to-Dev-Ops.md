# DevOps
Industry adopted DevOps for maximum efficiency, maintainability, and security. Software development based on the agile methodology. Development and IT (Ops) work together stressing cross team approach. It shortens the development lifecycle by avoiding silos, and focuses on CI/CD. DevOps offers **efficiency, predictability, maintainability, and security** of the ops process. Offers:
- lower failure rate of new software
- faster mean time for recovery
- shorter lead time between fix
- frequency of development
## CI/CD

## The Three Ways
### Principles of Flow
**Systems Thinking**, focusing on overall outcome, not a single issue. Reduces barriers between Dev and Ops, achievable when it is observable to the team.
### Principles of Feedback
Outputs determine the next step. Short loops allow 'fail fast', you can have negative and positive feedback loops. **shift left testing** is testing early and often to get feedback, this is an example of amplifying the feedback loop. **Improves multi team processes, visualizing metrics, and designing delivery flows.**
### Principles of Continuous Learning
Culture of experimentation, learning, and failure. Masker skills that are in portfolio and experiment with diverse skills.

### 1. Plan
Organize work to be done, have inputs from product owners, developers, IT, and security officers. Before the first line of code is written. Create the product roadmap, organize resource and priorities.
### 2. Create
Where code is designed and developed using version control.
### 3. Verify
Confirming the quality of code - security test, code quality analysis, parallel execution, automation. Devs fix flaws while devolving.
### 4. Package
After code is created and tested, process once release is ready for deployment. Approval/preapprovals, package config, triggered releases, staging and holding. Focused on activities involved once the release is ready for deployment.
### 5. Release
Pushing the code into production environment. Push in iterations for frequent releases. Release to smaller number of users before release.
### 6. Configure
Set up, manage, and maintain applications environments. Automated tools due to complexity of environments.
### 7. Monitor
Ensure health of infrastructure, software, and networks. Increases security, reliability, and agility.
